# Crypto Credentials

This project deploys both an ERC-1155 contract and a React app allowing users to earn an NFT after demonstrating they have some knowledge of calculus. This can be extended to earning NFTs for demonstrating knowledge of various kinds. Hence, Crypto Credentials.

You will need an Alchemy account and a Thirdweb account to deploy the contract.
